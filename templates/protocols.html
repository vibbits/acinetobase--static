      <p>
        The antimicrobial susceptibility and MICs were determined by broth microdilution method
        using the MIKRO-LA-TEST MIC NEFERM kit according to the manufacturer's instructions
        (Erba Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic) in triplicates. The results were evaluated according to
        the CLSI.<sup><a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#2">2</a></sup> In order to evaluate multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant
        (XDR), and pandrug-resistant (PDR) phenotypes,<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> susceptibility to tetracycline was tested
        too, using Etest (bioMérieux). The susceptibility to tetracycline was tested only in isolates
        carrying the tet(B) gene, for which resistance to tetracycline would alter the phenotype from
        XDR to PDR. Two isolates (AB14-VUB and AB189-VUB) not carrying genes conferring
        resistance to tetracycline were included as a negative control.

      <h2 class="vib-h2 text-vib-blue">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</h2>
      <p>
        Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for direct capsule visualization by
        labelling the capsule of 11 <em>A. baumannii</em> isolates, 9 modern clinical isolates and 3 established
        strains, which ranges from high to low densities. The fixation and staining of the bacteria were
        performed as described before.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> The cupule with the fixed pellet of bacteria (polymerized
        for 5 hours) was embedded in resin and polymerized (12h at 37°C, 48h at 45°C and 3 days at
        60°C). The ~60 nm slides of the resin were marked with acetate uranyl and placed on the
        electron microscopy grid.

      <h2 class="vib-h2 text-vib-blue">Macrocolony type morphology</h2>
      <p>
        5 µl of overnight bacterial suspension (~ 1x10<sup>8</sup> cells) was plated on Columbia Agar with 5%
        Sheep Blood purchased from BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The
        plates were incubated non-inverted for 6 days at 25°C and subsequently photographed by a
        Canon® camera.

      <h2 class="vib-h2 text-vib-blue"><em>Galleria mellonella</em> model of infection</h2>
      <p>
        TruLarv research grade larvae of <em>G. mellonella</em> (BioSystems Technology) were stored at 15°C
        no longer than 5 days after arrival and were incubated for 30 min at 4°C prior to injection.
        Bacteria from an overnight culture were washed with physiological saline (PS) (0.9% NaCl)
        and diluted to approx. 1x107 CFU/ml. The larvae were injected with 10 µl of PS containing
        1x105 CFU/ml of <em>A. baumannii</em> in the last left proleg using a 0.3 ml insulin syringe (BD
        MicroFine). Each of the nine selected strains of <em>A. baumannii</em> were injected into 10 larvae and
        10 larvae were injected with PS as a negative control. The experiments were carried in
        duplicates and the survival (assessed by keratinization and mobility) rate was evaluated each
        day in a period of 5 days.

      <p>
        1 ml of overnight culture in a 1.5 ml microtube was centrifuged for 2 min at 7000 rcf. The
        supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Subsequently, 875
        µl of PBS resuspended bacteria were mixed with 125 µl of LUDOX® LS colloidal silica (30
        wt. % suspension in H2O, Merk).<sup><a href="#5">5</a>, <a href="#6">6</a></sup> This mix was then centrifuged for 30 min at 12.000 rcf
        and immediately photographically recorded.
