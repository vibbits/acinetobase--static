# Requirements Interview

**Project**: Acinetobase

**Date**: 2021-09-07

**Conducted by**: James Collier

**Customers**: Charles Van der Henst and Adam Valcek

## Project outline

Produce a web-accessible database of bacterial isolates and capsule types. A user, browsing to the website, should
be able to click on a strain of bacteria and see characteristics. Or click on a capsule type and see a list of
isolates.

A page describing an isolate should dispplay characteristics, a microscope image, and a plot.

### Followup:
* Adam to send James sample data tables for isolates, images.


## User Information

Users are expected to have knowledge of bacterial biology but not bioinformatics knowledge.

Updating data is expected to be rare to begin with. An initial production site can be
updated on a monthly or yearly basis so solution should be quick and easy to implement.


## Features

* Copyright for code: [GPL3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) owned by VIB.

* Copyright for website material: TBA, maybe [CC](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/).

* Image and data hosting can be selected by VIB Bioinformatics core. Data will already be published.

* UI access to data to be defined by developer initially. Review later.

* Each page should display the date of last update of Acinetobase.

* There should be an "About" page with contact info and referencesfor software used etc.

* Each page should have the Acinetobase logo

* DNS: acinetobase.vib.be

### Nice to have:

* Track number of visitors and display on the page.

* Track visitor location and display privately.

## Timeline

Initial delivery ASAP but no hard deadline.

* First demo, mid-October 2021.
